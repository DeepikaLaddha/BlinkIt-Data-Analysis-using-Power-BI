# BlinkIt-Data-Analysis-using-Power-BI
In this Project, analysed dataset of BlinkIt online store from 2012 to 2022, based on client requirement. 
I have created important KPI's such as total sale, average sales, total items sold, and average rating.
Along with this analysed the sale based on different factors such as item containing Fat are sold more or item with no fat and in which tier cities it is sold most.
Which item is sold most, total sale of that item was calculated.
Along with this analysed the sale based on Outlet Establishment, Outlet location, Outlet size and Outlet type.

Insights Driven:-
Low Fat items such as Snacks food, Fruits and Vegetables are sold mostly in all the outlets. Most of the sale is obtained from the medium sized Supermarket type 1 established in 2018 in 3 tier cities.
